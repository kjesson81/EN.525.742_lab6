NOTE: This source code is designed to have an IIC AXI Periphreal component in the design!
This will not work with the default block design, as that uses the PS UART for Linux SW application.
To use the baremetal Vitis project, one will need to put an IIC periphreal in the block design instead
of the PS IIC.
